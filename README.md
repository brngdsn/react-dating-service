# Dating Service

Challenge here was to fork a boilerplate and provide a solution as if for a client. Leveraging `react-redux` pattern containers for higher-order components, and pure components for presentation. As well as selector pattern for flexible state shapes. This repo contains the built code from the source, and sepcifically used for demo hosting purposes.
